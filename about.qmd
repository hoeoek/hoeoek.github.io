I am a PhD student working on leveraging machine learning to increase competitiveness for bio-based supply chains. With a strong background in forestry, I have honed my skills in statistical modeling in R and have contributed to research projects, providing data analysis and drone photogrammetry support. My teaching experience includes instructing master-level students in a forestry program, where I shared my passion for data-driven solutions towards enhancing supply chain resilience.

I believe in the power of open-source technologies to democratize access to essential tools and data, allowing for more effective and inclusive decision-making in the bio-based industry and beyond.

## Toolkit
