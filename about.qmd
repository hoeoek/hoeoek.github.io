I am a PhD student working on building a pipeline for automatic image annotation for computer vision applications in forest operations. With a strong background in forestry and a passion for tech, I have honed my skills in statistical modeling and have contributed to research projects, providing data analysis and drone photogrammetry support. 

I believe in the power of open-source technologies to democratize access to essential tools and data, allowing for more effective and inclusive decision-making in the bio-based industry and beyond.
